# Pyrus
## Description
Pyrus is a collection of pre-coded Python 3.6+ scripts written by me while I learn Python.
### Usage
All individual scripts are stand-alone. They are programmed to be run via the command-line and they do not have any external file dependencies such as config files or third-party modules. All end-user input is requested via the input() function, when required.
### License
This repository and all its contents are covered under a standard MIT license.
