# Pyrus
## Description
Pyrus is a collection of pre-coded Python 3.x scripts written by me while I learn Python.

### Usage
All individual scripts are stand-alone. They are programmed to be run via the command-line and they do not have any external file dependencies such as config files or third-party modules. All end-user input is requested via the input() function, when required.

Any script with a input() function has an optional built-in sys.quit() to terminate the script.
